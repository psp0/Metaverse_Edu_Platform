  m_Title: USS transitions
  m_BodyText:
  - "<b>USS transitions</b> provide an elegant way to animate changes in visual properties
    over time. They can help create effects like smoothly fading an element in and
    out, or moving it across the screen over time. This extra bit of \"juice\" can
    make for a more dynamic and engaging user experience. \n\nLike their CSS counterparts,
    USS transitions support options for delay and duration. They also include a variety
    of easing functions to go beyond basic linear animation. \n\nThis can help provide
    visual feedback to the user as they interact with the UI (e.g., hover effects
    and focus changes)."
  - "To create an animation, use the <b>transition</b> property with another property
    that you want to modify.\n\nFor example, this adds a simple transition to a Button's
    background color:\n<b>\nButton {\n    transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}</b>\n\nIf
    the <b>background-color</b> of a Button element changes, it changes gradually
    over a duration of 0.3 seconds, using an <b>ease-in-out</b> timing.\n\nThe function
    starts slowly, speeds up, then slows down towards the end of the transition."
  - "You can also define multiple transitions. This example applies transitions on
    the scale and background-color properties:\n<b>\n.classA {\n    transition-property:
    scale, background-color;\n    transition-duration: 1s, 0.5s;\n    transition-delay:
    0s, 600ms;\n    transition-timing-function: ease-in-sine, ease-out-elastic;\n}</b>\n\nThe
    first transition is on the scale property. It has a duration of 1s, a delay of
    0s, and the ease-in-sine easing function.\n\nThe second transition is on the
    background-color. It has a duration of 0.5s, a delay of 600ms, and the ease-out-elastic
    easing function."
  - "Compare the default Button with one that uses USS transitions. \n\nBoth buttons
    have <b>:hover</b> pseudo-classes, but the addition of a <b>transition-duration</b>
    property in the latter makes it smoothly change from one state to another.\n\nClick
    the Toggle to show and hide the example container. This adds and removes a class
    selector containing a <b>translate</b> value.\n\nSimply using a <i>transition
    time</i> and <i>easing function</i> creates a USS transition. The container then
    can smoothly animate on and off screen."
