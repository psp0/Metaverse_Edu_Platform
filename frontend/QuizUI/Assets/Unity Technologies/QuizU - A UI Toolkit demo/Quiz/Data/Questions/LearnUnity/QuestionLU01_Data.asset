  m_FeedbackCorrect: "The term real-time describes how quickly an image is rendered
    (or displayed) on the screen. Eliminating the need to wait for renders has changed

    offline rendering to real-time remove weeks or months from the production cycle,
    and give themselves more time to experiment with new ideas or polish what\u2019s
    already been designed."
