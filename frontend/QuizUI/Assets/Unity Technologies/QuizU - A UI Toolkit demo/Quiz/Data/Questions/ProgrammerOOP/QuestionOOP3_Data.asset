  - FontSize: 2
    Text: Which of the following statements are true about parent (base) and child
      (derived) classes?
  - FontSize: 1
    Text: '1. A class can only inherit from a single class.

      2. Protected variables
      and methods can be accessed from the child class, even if they are separate
      scripts.

      3. Private variables and methods can be accessed from the child
      class, even if they are separate scripts.

      4. If Class C derives from
      Class B, which derives from Class A, Class C only inherits behaviors from Class
      B.'

    Text: All are true.
  m_FeedbackCorrect: For number 3, private variables and methods can only be accessed
    by derived classes if those classes are nested in their base class. For number
    4, Class C would actually inherit from all base classes, which would include
    Class B and Class A.
