    Text: Base map, normal map, and specular map
  m_FeedbackCorrect: "The URP/Lit Shader calls for a Base Map to specify color. Other
    shaders commonly call this property Albedo or Diffuse Map (even though, technically,
    these terms don\u2019t mean exactly the same thing)."
  m_FeedbackIncorrect: Shaders and materials work together to define all the characteristics
    of a mesh surface during the rendering process. A material is an asset that works
    with a shader to define how meshes will be rendered.
