  m_FeedbackCorrect: "<b>Spawn:</b> If active, Unity calls this every Frame, and
    computes the amount of particles to spawn. <b>Initialize:</b> Unity calls this
    at the \u201Cbirth\u201D of every particle. This defines the initial state of
    the particle. <b>Update:</b> Unity calls this every frame for all particles,
    and uses this to perform simulations; for example, Forces and Collisions. <b>Output:</b>
    Unity calls this every frame for every particle. This determines the shape of
    a particle, and performs pre-render transformations."
