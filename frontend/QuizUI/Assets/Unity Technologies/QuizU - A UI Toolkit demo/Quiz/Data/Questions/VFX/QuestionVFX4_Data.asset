    Text: "You\u2019re trying to make a particle system that produces a steady stream
      of particles. However, you notice that there are large gaps in the emission
      of particles. What could be done to resolve these gaps? Select all answers
      that apply."

  m_FeedbackCorrect: The Max Particles property represents the maximum number of
    particles in the system at once. If the limit is reached, some particles are
    removed. If you wanted to have a steady stream of particles here, you could decrease
    the Rate over Time to reduce the number emitted per second, decrease the Start
    Lifetime so that the particles would not stay on screen for as long, or just
    increase the Max Particles to accommodate more particles on screen at a time.
