    Text: "You\u2019re creating an outdoors scene and have added  multiple ambient
      effects, one of which is a frog song. The frog song is a spatial audio effect,
      and the max distance is set to be right at the edge of a pond. However, even
      when the player is at the pond, the frog song is hard to hear over the other
      effects.\n"

  m_FeedbackCorrect: A Priority setting of 0 indicates the most important audio effect
    in Unity. The lower you set the audio source, the more priority Unity will give
    to playing that sound over another.
  m_FeedbackIncorrect: A Priority setting of 0 indicates the most important audio
    effect in Unity. The lower you set the audio source, the more priority Unity
    will give to playing that sound over another.
