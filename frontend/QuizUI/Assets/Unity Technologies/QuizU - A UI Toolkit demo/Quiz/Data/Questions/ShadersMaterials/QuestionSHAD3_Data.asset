    Text: "It\u2019s common to import a material that was originally made for a shader
      that isn\u2019t present in the current project. To fix, specify a shader that
      is in the project."
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: Materials appear pink if they are missing a base map or color. To fix,
      add a color.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: "A material created for one GameObject can\u2019t be applied to another
      without being configured properly. To fix, adjust the material for each new
      GameObject."
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: A pink material indicates an error in the shader script. To fix, correct
      the error or select a different shader.
  - IsCorrect: 1
    Text: When a material is built for a shader of a different render pipeline than
      the current project, it is bright magenta (pink) to alert you.
  m_FeedbackCorrect: When a material is built for a shader of a different render
    pipeline than the current project, it is bright magenta (pink) to alert you.
  m_FeedbackIncorrect: Shaders and materials work together to define all the characteristics
    of a mesh surface during the rendering process. A material is an asset that works
    with a shader to define how meshes will be rendered.
