  m_FeedbackCorrect: The Master Stack is the end point of a Shader Graph that defines
    the final surface appearance of a shader. It lists the major shader properties
    of a Vertex and a Fragment shader and provides you with the end nodes where you
    will plug in the necessary values.
  m_FeedbackIncorrect: Shaders and materials work together to define all the characteristics
    of a mesh surface during the rendering process. A material is an asset that works
    with a shader to define how meshes will be rendered.
