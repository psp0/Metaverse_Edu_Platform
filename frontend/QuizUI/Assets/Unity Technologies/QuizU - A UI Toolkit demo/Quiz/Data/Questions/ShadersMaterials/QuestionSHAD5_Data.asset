    Text: What is physically based rendering (PBR)?
  m_Skills: Skill-L2-Art.Shad-1
  m_ShuffleAnswers: 1
  m_Answers:
  - IsCorrect: 1
    Text: Rendering using shaders that most closely simulate the real-world behavior
      and properties of light.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: Rendering in 3D using materials designed to look like real objects.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: Rendering that uses normal maps and height maps to simulate physical variations
      on a mesh.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: Rendering that uses a combination of vertex and fragment shaders to achieve
      realistic results.
  m_FeedbackCorrect: PBR simulates the real-world principles of physics and light
    to generate realistic shadows, reflections, ambient light, and other effects
    of light on 3D surfaces.
  m_FeedbackIncorrect: Shaders and materials work together to define all the characteristics
    of a mesh surface during the rendering process. A material is an asset that works
    with a shader to define how meshes will be rendered.
