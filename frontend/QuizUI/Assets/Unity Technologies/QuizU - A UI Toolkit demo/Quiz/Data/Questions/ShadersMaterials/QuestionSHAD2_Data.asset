    Text: A lit shader allows you to add emissive light to an object, so that it
      can appear to light up. An unlit shader does not, but using unlit shaders increases
      performance.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: A lit shader only works with the Universal Render Pipeline. Other render
      pipelines use unlit shaders.
  - IsCorrect: 1
    Text: A lit shader adds shadows and reflections according to the light that reaches
      the object. An unlit shader ignores the effects of light.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: None of the above.
  m_FeedbackCorrect: "Lit shaders respond to the light in the scene, and unlit shaders
    don\u2019t. Unlit shaders are useful for certain artistic effects or for optimized
    projects that run more efficiently by not using lighting."
