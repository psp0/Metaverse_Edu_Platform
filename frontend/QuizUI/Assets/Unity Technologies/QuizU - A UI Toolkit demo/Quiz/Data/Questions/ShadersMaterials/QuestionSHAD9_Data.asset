  m_FeedbackCorrect: The Blackboard contains the properties that will be available
    to artists who use this shader to create materials. Here you can define property
    types as well as their names, attributes, and default values.
  m_FeedbackIncorrect: Shaders and materials work together to define all the characteristics
    of a mesh surface during the rendering process. A material is an asset that works
    with a shader to define how meshes will be rendered.
