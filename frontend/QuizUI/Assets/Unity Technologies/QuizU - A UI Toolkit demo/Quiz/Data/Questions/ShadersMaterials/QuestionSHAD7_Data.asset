  m_Answers:
  - IsCorrect: 1
    Text: A normal map specifies the direction that a surface faces at a given point;
      a height map specifies how high from the mesh to raise the rendered surface.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: A normal map contains the data of the basic mesh before rendering, and
      the height map specifies how high from the normal surface to raise the rendered
      surface.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: A normal map specifies the normal color to render the mesh, and the height
      map specifies how high the reflectivity of the surface will be rendered.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: A normal map specifies the normal properties of the surface; a height map
      specifies how those properties change with the distance  to the viewer.
  m_FeedbackCorrect: Normals are values in the mesh data that define the direction
    each vertex is facing. A normal map sets these values over an entire surface.
    Height maps indicate the relative height of each pixel from the mesh.
  m_FeedbackIncorrect: Shaders and materials work together to define all the characteristics
    of a mesh surface during the rendering process. A material is an asset that works
    with a shader to define how meshes will be rendered.
