  m_FeedbackCorrect: "Any audio that the viewer or player can hear, but that entities
    within the world of the experience can\u2019t hear, is an example of non-diegetic
    audio. For example, background music that\u2019s used to enhance the mood of
    a scene, but isn\u2019t playing from an in-environment source such as a radio,
    is non-diegetic."
