    Text: The geometric data of a GameObject, consisting of vertices and normals.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: The exterior surface of a GameObject, to which materials are applied.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: A series of polygons that define the surface of a GameObject.
  - IsCorrect: 1
    Text: All of the above.
  m_FeedbackCorrect: The mesh is the 3D skeleton of your GameObject. It consists
    of vertices that define polygons, and normals that specify the directions vertices
    face. Every GameObject in Unity has a mesh. It is the geometric element of the
    object.
  m_FeedbackIncorrect: Shaders and materials work together to define all the characteristics
    of a mesh surface during the rendering process. A material is an asset that works
    with a shader to define how meshes will be rendered.
