  - IsCorrect: 1
    Text: VFX Graph supports a higher particle count than the Particle System.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: VFX Graph runs on the CPU, while the Particle system runs on the GPU.
  - IsCorrect: 1
    Text: "The Particle System uses Unity\u2019s underlying physics system, allowing
      particles to interact with other physics-based objects in the scene."
  - IsCorrect: 1
    Text: Even though the Particle System is a bit simpler to use, VFX Graph is capable
      of producing more complex simulations and allows for more customizable behaviors.
  m_FeedbackCorrect: "VFX Graph supports millions of particles, while the Particle
    System only supports thousands. VFX Graph runs on the GPU, while the Particle
    System runs on the CPU. The Particle System uses Unity\u2019s underlying physics
    system, allowing the particles to interact with other physics-based objects in
    the scene. Even though the Particle System is a bit simpler to use, VFX Graph
    is capable of producing more complex simulations."
