  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: If the particles have noise, they were created using VFX Graph, since the
      Particle System does not support noise
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: If the individual particles are 3D meshes, they were created using VFX
      Graph, since the Particle System only supports 2D textures.
  - IsCorrect: 0
    Text: If the particles have any elements of transparency, they were created using
      VFX Graph, since the Particle System does not support transparency.
  - IsCorrect: 1
    Text: If you double-click on a VFX Graph object in the Project window, it will
      open in the VFX Graph window.
  m_FeedbackCorrect: "It would be very difficult to know just from looking at a particle
    system whether it was created using VFX Graph or with the Particle System, since
    they both have very broad, similar capabilities. To be sure, you would want to
    click on the object and see which system it\u2019s using."
